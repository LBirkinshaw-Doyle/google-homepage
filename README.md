Recreation of www.google.com/ to learn HTML/CSS

Using developer/inspect tools to examine and understand https://www.google.com as it appeared for me.
Deconstruction of google methods and then rebuilt as much as possible without JavaScript functionality and my understanding.

Differences as of 20/07/2021
-whitespace growth is different from source
-missing JS on Google Apps, Sign in, Search bar, I'm Feeling Lucky, Settings
-Google apps tip doesn't appear by cursor

The project was made responsive with flexbox.

I learnt a lot of html/css and taking the time to breakdown how and what was being used with developer tools gave me lots of insight.
As always, google well.
